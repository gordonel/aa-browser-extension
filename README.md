# YaspFi Smart wallet

We have integrated the Safe Proxy Kit into our wallet, allowing for easy execution of multiple transactions and seamless creation of Safe Wallets. Additionally, we have added Gelato support for sponsored transactions through 1Balance, enabling users to create a wallet without ETH on their first transaction. At YaspFi, we prioritize user experience and security, which is why we have added onboarding to our smart wallet through Web3Auth.

With YaspFi you can store, invest and exchange your funds on multiple networks without ever worrying about losing access. Yasp.Fi provides comprehensive analytics and risk assessment score to help users make data-based investment decisions. Our mission is to make decentralized finance more user-friendly, transparent, and accessible to a wider audience.
